------- ideas for further tests & new features -----------
ordered by:
=> items with highest impact / most risk are the highest
=> no dependencies on items lower in the list
=> real example from OpenCV docs as high as possible

*) implement or simulate for-loops (map, reduce, zip, append, extend)
    - add the modify a variable part
    - add the continue/break statements
    - what about flow_control connector for LoopStart() / LoopStop() elements?
    - make it thread safe (ie: check for self.i read/write races in is_ready()/is_done()/run_or_block())
    - make it possible to execute on 2 list items at the same time by different processing units
*) implement some OpenCV functions (GaussianBlur, split, Canny, dilate, threshold, findContours, arcLength, approxPolyDP, contourArea, isContourConvex, drawContours)
*) implement some NumPy functions (reshape, max, dot)
*) implement some Python functions (range, len, sqrt, abs)
*) implement list-access ([])
*) recreate one of the OpenCV example programs: "squares.py"
*) implement Python bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
*) store values and & valid attribute of connectors
*) add "flow" parameter in element constructors, to prevent the "flow.add_element()" statements
*) implement exceptions and warnings, for example:
    - Divide-by-zero
    - OpenCV exceptions
    - conditional assignment undefined
    - define element with same class_name as an other element
    - try to run PythonComparisonBase, which has no run() function
    - connect an element which is not added to the flow (connect as src; connect as dst)
    - connect 2 input_connectors with each other
    - connect 2 output_connectors with each other
*) robustness of elements with variable number of inputs (ie: ConditionalAssignment)
    - check save/load from databse
    - check disconnect/reconnect
