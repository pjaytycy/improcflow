------- ideas for further tests & new features -----------
ordered by:
=> items with highest impact / most risk are the highest
=> no dependencies on items lower in the list
=> real example from OpenCV docs as high as possible

*) implement control-flow next to the data-flow
*) implement Python arithmetic operators (, +, -, *, /, %, **, //)
*) implement Python comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)
*) implement Python logical operators (and, or, not)
*) implement sub-routines
*) implement or simulate for-loops (map, reduce, zip, append, extend)
*) implement some OpenCV functions (GaussianBlur, split, Canny, dilate, threshold, findContours, arcLength, approxPolyDP, contourArea, isContourConvex, drawContours)
*) implement some NumPy functions (reshape, max, dot)
*) implement some Python functions (range, len, sqrt, abs)
*) implement list-access ([])
*) recreate one of the OpenCV example programs: "squares.py"
*) implement Python bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
*) remove duplicate code in InputImage / InputBoolean classes (maybe consolidate into 1 class)
*) store values and & valid attribute of connectors
